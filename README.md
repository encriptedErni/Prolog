  <h2>RecorridosdeOperaciones Project</h2>
  <p>The RecorridosdeOperaciones project is designed to explore pure logic programming. It involves solving problems related to operation sequences, where the goal is to find valid sequences of operations to reach a desired result. The project utilizes only clauses (rules and facts), terms (constants, variables, structures), and unification to implement the solution. It strictly follows the principles of pure logic programming and does not rely on any built-in predicates or system libraries.</p>
  <h2>automataCelular Project</h2>
  <p>The automataCelular project focuses on implementing a cellular automaton using ISO-Prolog arithmetic. A cellular automaton is composed of an infinite tape containing cells, each with a specific color. The state of the tape evolves by applying a set of rules that determine how the colors of the cells change. The project follows the principles of ISO-Prolog arithmetic and avoids using any pre-defined predicates or system libraries. All necessary predicates and functionalities are implemented within the project itself.</p>
  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>To use these projects, follow the instructions provided in each project's folder. Make sure you have a Prolog interpreter installed and configured on your system. You can run the projects by loading the necessary files and executing the main predicates as described in the project documentation.</p>
  <p>Please note that these projects are intended for educational purposes and serve as examples of pure logic programming and ISO-Prolog arithmetic. Feel free to explore, modify, and extend the projects according to your needs.</p>
  <p>For more information on logic programming, pure logic programming, and ISO-Prolog, please refer to the relevant resources and documentation available online.</p>
